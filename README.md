# Sample Modern C++ project

This was a project that I made alone for a university course. It is a mock command line social network. Only the source code is provide you can inspect it to evaluate my skills 
in the C++ language.
While itself (variables, functions and etc...) is in English the text displayed at runtim is in Italian due to the requirement of the course.
